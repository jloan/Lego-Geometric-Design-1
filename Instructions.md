###  * 11 total pieces  
###  * 1 – 6x16 baseplate (bright green) 
###  * 10 – 2x4 bricks (2 pink, 2 yellow, 2 purple, two light green, two red) 
 
Holding the base plate with the 6 side being the top; beginning at the top of the plate, place the first pink brick lengthwise on the green baseplate with one connection of the base plate not covered on the top and two sides of the brick. 

Place the second pink brick below the first with the 2 side of brick centered on the 4 side of the first brick. 

Place the two yellow bricks centered on each 4 side of the second pink brick (they will overhang the baseplate by two connections on each side) 

Place the two purple bricks with the 4 side facing up below the 2 side of the second pink brick with each brick covering 3 connections on the base plate and overhanging by one connection on each side of the baseplate. 

Center the 2 side of one red brick directly below the two purple bricks in the center of the baseplate. 

Place the two light green bricks centered on each 4 side of the first red brick (they will overhang the baseplate by two connections on each side) 

Place the second red brick with the 4 side facing up below the first red brick leaving one connection of the base plate not covered at the bottom and two sides of the brick.
